# kvform
dynamic model creation

This class allows to manage models not based on a concrete table on database.
Model fields and attributes are stored in a dedicated structure and can be changed from the admin.

Django ModelForm and all other generic views works as expected.

TODO:
* ORM does not work: there is no interface by now
* not all fields type at the moment are managed

THIS IS AN ALPHA.
